T1D Learning Camp is an educational game to teach healthy eating habits
to children with type 1 diabetes, with the aim of reducing complexity and
increasing personalized interactivity. 

In the game, a child plays as a dog character with type 1 diabetes at a
sleepaway camp. A character named “Dr. Robot” acts as a guide for the child
throughout the camp experience. The game consists of text-and-response-based
lessons, minigames to reinforce concepts, and a campground island to chat
with non-playable characters and traverse between sections.

The most technical aspects of this project are the lessons, which leverage
generative AI for personalized conversations. In these lessons, the player
learns about concepts such as blood sugar, high- and low-carbohydrate foods,
and symptoms of high and low blood sugar. Dr. Robot frequently asks questions
relevant to the lesson to connect the topics to the child’s life and to help
the child have a good understanding. It would be impossible to manually map
out the endless conversation pathways to match every potential user-inputted
response, so the use of a large language model allows for the creation of
dynamic responses to the player in real time.
